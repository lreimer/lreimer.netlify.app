# Bluise - A Nuxt.js & Netlify CMS boilerplate.

I wanted to explore Netlify CMS & Tailwind CSS, ended up creating this boilerplate.

So far we've got:

- Blog w/ posts, including pagination.
- Configurable manifest & global settings.
- CSS Markdown (Thanks to [https://github.com/iandinwoodie/github-markdown-tailwindcss/blob/master/markdown.css]).
- Dynamic pages.
- PWA ready.
- SEO ready for posts & pages.
- Signup form (using Netlify Forms).
- Tools (Commitlint, Husky).
- Typescript.

Few things I'd like to add in the future:

- Contact form under \_slug.
- Dynamic sections/widgets.
- Responsive CSS markdown.
- Tests

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-tab)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

```bash
# ensure you have the prerequisites
# install
brew install node && brew install yarn

# OR update
brew update && brew upgrade && brew install yarn

# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
yarn dev

# build for production with minification
yarn generate

# run all tests
yarn test
```

### Using Netlify CMS

1. Deploy to Netlify.
2. Enable Identity under Settings.
3. Configure registration preferences & external providers if needed.
4. Enable Git Gateway.

_Note: You'll need to specify the Netlify URL when browsing the admin page locally._
